`confess` is a configuration wrapper around
[`convict`](https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict).

## The problem

Setting up configuration and using configuration seem to be two different
concerns approached by other configuration modules. Convict is a module that has
(in my opinion) done a really good job at setting up configuration. It's
extensible, easy to integrate with in any system, and can be customized to do
just about anything the other configuration loaders can do. Using it, though,
can be a pain. You create a `config.js` or `config/index.js` or something that
loads convict and configures your configuration. That's the good part. But when
you want to use your configuration, it's only available if you `require()` it
from wherever you are in your file system, which could requires a lot of `../`.

This module makes abstracts my most common use cases of setting up configuration
with convict, with the convenience of use a require without paths.

# Installation

```bash
npm install --save confess
```

# Usage

In the root of your project create a folder called `config/`.

In this folder, there will be 3 classes of files:

* **Schema definition file** - This is the file that defines the schema of the
main configuration options. This file should export an object that you would use
to define your `convict` configuration. Documentation on how to set up the
schema can be found [here](https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict#the-schema).
The default name for this file is `index.js`.

* **Default configuration file** - This file gets loaded and merged into the
config object using `convict`'s
[`.load()`](https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict#configloadobject) method.
The default name for this file is `default.js`.

* **Environment configuration files** - The default schema that gets loaded
includes and environment configuration that you can set with an environment
variable (`NODE_ENV`) or with a flag (`--env`). The default environment is
`development` so it loads `development.js`. It is recommended that you create
multiple environment configuration files, such as `test` and `production`. Any
configuration options set in these files with override those in default and the
schema defaults.

# Configuration

You can override things like the folder and schema filename by putting a
`.confessrc` file in the root of your project.

```json
{
  "extension": "js", // can be js or json
  "schemaPrefix": "index",
  "defaultPrefix": "default",
  "defaultEnv": "development",
  "configDir": "config", // relative dir to cwd
  "cwd": "" // This defaults to what process.cwd() is
}
```

If anyone would like to add more file extension support, submit an issue or pull request. I stuck with just `js` and `json` because this is nodejs/iojs.
